# RDF Canonicalization in TypeScript

This is a proof-of-concept implementation (under development) of the [RDF Dataset Canonicalization](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-canon/) algorithm.

Note that the algorithm is being specified by the W3C [RDF Dataset Canonicalization and Hash Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/rch), 
and nothing is finalâ€¦

A proper documentation will come further when the code is complete.
